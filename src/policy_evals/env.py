"""A minimal deterministic reach-and-grasp environment.

**What this is and is not.** It is a kinematic environment, not a physics
simulator: joints integrate commanded deltas subject to limits and rate caps,
and there are no contacts, no dynamics and no friction. It is genuinely
*closed-loop* — the policy's action changes the state, the next observation
depends on that action, and errors compound exactly as they would on hardware —
which is the property that offline action-error metrics fundamentally cannot
give you.

It exists so the harness around it (registry, paired seeding, statistics,
regression gating) can be built, tested and trusted before a MuJoCo or Isaac
scene is wired in. Everything above `Environment` is simulator-agnostic; swapping
in a real one means implementing `reset` and `step` and nothing else.

Do not report success rates from this environment as robot results. They are
harness results.
